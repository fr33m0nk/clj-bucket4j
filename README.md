### Example usage as a [throttler](https://bucket4j.com/8.3.0/toc.html#using-bucket-as-throttler)

#### Require at the REPL with:
```clojure
(require '[fr33m0nk.clj-bucket4j :as b4j])
```

> Suppose you need to have a fresh exchange rate between dollars and euros. To get the rate you continuously poll the third-party provider, and by contract with the provider you should poll not often than 100 times per 1 minute, else provider will block your IP:

```clojure
;; define the limit 100 times per 1 minute
(def simple-bandwidth (b4j/simple-bandwidth 100 60000))

;; construct the bucket
(def bucket (-> (b4j/bucket-builder)
                 (b4j/add-limit simple-bandwidth)
                 (b4j/build)))
                 
(def exchange-rates (atom 0.0))                 

;; do polling in infinite loop
(while true
  ;; Consume a token from the token bucket.
  ;; If a token is not available this method will block until the refill adds one to the bucket.
  (b4j/block-and-consume bucket 1)
  
  (swap! exchange-rate (poll-exchange-rate)))
  
```
